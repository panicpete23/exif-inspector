# EXIF Inspector

A lightweight, **offline** EXIF and file metadata extractor written in Python. Ideal for blue-team triage, DFIR notes, or quick inventorying of image collections.

## Features
- Works on a single file or an entire directory (with `-r` for recursion)
- Extracts EXIF for images using Pillow (where available)
- Records filesystem metadata: size, created/modified timestamps
- Optional **SHA-256** hashing for integrity checks (`--hash`)
- Export to **CSV** and/or **JSON**
- Minimal console table for a quick glance

## Install
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Inspect a single file and print a quick view:
```bash
python exif_inspector.py ./photo.jpg
```

Walk a folder recursively and save outputs:
```bash
python exif_inspector.py ./samples -r --csv report.csv --json report.json
```

Include SHA-256 hashing (slower):
```bash
python exif_inspector.py ./samples -r --hash --csv hashes.csv
```

Filter by extensions (example: only JPEG and PNG):
```bash
python exif_inspector.py ./samples -r --filter-ext jpg,jpeg,png
```

## Notes
- EXIF availability depends on the file and Pillow support. JPEG/TIFF are safest. Some PNGs may include textual metadata; HEIC/HEIF support varies.
- Non-image files still receive filesystem metadata and optional hash values.

## Why this project?
A simple, audit-friendly tool you can keep offline. Good for quick wins on your GitHub and genuinely useful for everyday investigations.
